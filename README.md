# Ty Memory Leak Manager Plugin

This is a TygerFramework plugin used to display the current memory usage as an overlay in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger.

## Installing

Manual installation is required for this plugin. Installation involves two files being downloaded and added to your Ty game folder.

### Setting Up TygerFramework

Firstly, if you don't already have plugins set up, download the release version of [TygerFramework](https://github.com/ElusiveFluffy/TygerFramework/releases) (v1.1.0+). You will have a file called 'XInput9_1_0.dll'. 

Place this file in your Ty game folder and launch the game. Once the game is booted up, close it and you should find a Plugins folder has been created. 

### Adding This Plugin

Next, head to the releases page for this plugin and download the release version of 'Ty MLM Plugin.dll'. Place the downloaded dll into your 'Plugins' folder.

To test if the plugin is recognised, launch Ty and check the loaded plugins listed in the TygerFramework window. If you don't see this window, press F1.

## Usage

To use the plugin, press Ctrl+F4 together. This will make the memory usage overlay appear. If you want to hide the overlay, simply press the combination again.

To move the overlay, press F1 to display the TygerFramework menu and drag the memory usage overlay to wherever you want it before pressing F1 to lock it into place.

Pressing F4 on its own will toggle additional information on the overlay.
